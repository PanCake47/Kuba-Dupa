Hello, if you are here, that means your name is Filip R., the only visitor of this repository. 

This repository isn't a single project, it contains for now 2 folders with different kinds of small creations of mine. I use it for storing the more or less important things I have done on my "Learning How to Code" journey. The repository will be constantly expanding through time.

1. The first folder "aplikacje_python" contains a random bunch of scripts created thanks to random ideas that came through my head.

Number_Guess:
Simple game that you could say by name is just guessing numbers. 

Typing_Game:
It's a speed typing application to test your writing skills.

Vector_Transformer:
It is a script to picture 2d vectors transformed using matrices. You can define 3 values: matrix, vector and rotation angle. It is the 1.0 version, I'm planning to upgrade it by adding possibility to work on 3d vectors, but right now it's 2 am and I wake up at 6:40 so that shall be it for now.  

2. Second folder "gry_pygame" is reserved for my simple game projects that I made using the python library "pygame-ce".

Juke_The_Stars:
Just a game with a fancy name, goofy jumping, dodging falling objects (stars). There is a bug with getting stuck under the display window after getting hit by the star mid-jump. 

Pong:
Pong, not particularly the best pong but a working pong. 

Snake:
I bet you can read. It is really fun as well.
